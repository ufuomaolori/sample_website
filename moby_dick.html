            The <a href="http://www.sofcover.io/"></a>Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks
            like the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> and <a
                href="http://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good
            for making more traditional books, such as the
            novel<em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a
            short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.
